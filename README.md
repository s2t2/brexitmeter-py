# Brexitmeter (Python)

The "Brexitmeter" is a convolutional neural network trained to classify the degree to which any given Tweet expresses pro-Europe or pro-Brexit sentiments on a numeric scale from zero to one, where lower scores represent pro-Europe and higher scores represent pro-Brexit.

This repository contains a Python application for running the classifier via command-line interface or Twitter Bot. :robot: :bird:

See the [Contributor's Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to run the classifier yourself!
