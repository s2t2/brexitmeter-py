# Brexitmeter

The Brexitmeter is a neural network model trained to classify the degree to which any given Tweet expresses pro-Europe or pro-Brexit sentiments on a numeric scale from zero to one, where lower scores represent pro-Europe and higher scores represent pro-Brexit.

This repository contains a Python application capable of running the classifier via command-line or Twitter Bot interface.

See the [Contributor's Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to run the client or the bot yourself!
